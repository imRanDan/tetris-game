# TetrisJS
Tetris, made with vanilla JavaScript!

**Link to project:** https://tetris-js-game.netlify.app/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

I used keyCodes, for loops, and more to get this game running. It was tricky for some parts, like how I would create the canvas, and I feel i did not do it in the best manner, but it works!

## Optimizations

I would have changed the method of creating the canvas, and i think i should add instructions too.

## Lessons Learned:

Practicing my JavaScript has made me feel more secure in my competency. I wanted to create something of interest and have found that making the game was a lot of fun.
